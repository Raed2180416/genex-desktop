/**
 * What a Windows install asks of main before anything else runs.
 *
 * Squirrel, the per-user installer forge.config.cjs builds, starts the app with one
 * `--squirrel-*` argument after it installs or updates it and before it removes it. That launch
 * must do the step's work (the Start menu and desktop shortcuts, through Squirrel's own
 * Update.exe beside the versioned app folder) and exit at once: no window, no profile, no core.
 *
 * The app user model id ties notifications and the taskbar to the Start menu shortcut. Inside a
 * Squirrel install Electron sets Squirrel's own (`com.squirrel.genex.genex`, the id its shortcut
 * carries), so main sets Genex's only for a copy Squirrel did not install.
