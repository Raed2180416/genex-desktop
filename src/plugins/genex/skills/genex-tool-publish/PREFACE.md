# Genex publishing in AI Game Studio

You are building inside AI Game Studio. Below the upstream marker is Genex's publishing card,
unchanged. Where it disagrees with this preface, this preface wins.

- Publishing is one step: `genex__publish {"operation":"gallery"}` exports the game, updates its
  draft page and makes that same build the public version (`npx genex publish` the first time,
  `preview` then `promote` after). Use it when the user wants the game published or online.
  `npx genex preview` alone is `genex__publish {"operation":"draft"}`: an unlisted test build that
  leaves the public version as it is. Each asks the user first and returns a job: follow it with
  `genex__publish-status {"operation":"wait","jobId":"<jobId>"}`, then give the user the operation’s
  reported link verbatim: `galleryUrl` for a public release, `draftUrl` for a draft. Do not
  construct a URL or report a draft link as the public release. If the job has not succeeded,
  report its actual state rather than claiming publication.
- Studio exports and uploads the game itself. Glue step 3 (the CLI as a dev dependency) and
  `init --convert` do not apply, and `npx genex pull` is not available. Glue steps 1 and 2 still
  apply; for step 2 read `genex__skill {"name":"genex-threejs-embed-auth"}`.
- The preflight lines arrive in `genex__publish-status` as warnings. Treat them as the card says.
- `npx genex doctor` is `genex__cli {"command":"doctor"}`. Other commands map onto Studio tools as
  the `genex` skill describes (`genex__skill {"name":"genex"}`).
