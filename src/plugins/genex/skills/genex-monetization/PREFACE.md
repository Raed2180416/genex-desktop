# Genex shops in AI Game Studio

You are building inside AI Game Studio. Below the upstream marker is Genex's monetization card,
unchanged. Where it disagrees with this preface, this preface wins.

- `npx genex shop list`: `genex__cli {"command":"shop list"}`.
- `npx genex shop add|set|remove|test`: `genex__cli-paid`, with the item name or sku in `args` and
  the flags by name in `options`, for example
  `genex__cli-paid {"command":"shop add","args":"Iron Key","options":{"price":100,"type":"durable"}}`.
  The user approves each call, because it changes what the game sells.
- Shop commands need the game's hosted project: publish a draft with
  `genex__publish {"operation":"draft"}` first.
- `npx genex image` for item art is `genex__asset` with operation `image`; use the image URL it
  reports as the item's `icon`.
- Other commands map onto Studio tools as the `genex` skill describes
  (`genex__skill {"name":"genex"}`).
