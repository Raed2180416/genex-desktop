/**
 * An ANCHORED floating surface — a panel that hangs off the control that opened
 * it, leaving the page lit and usable behind it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `dropdown-menu.tsx`. That primitive is a Radix
 * *menu*: it owns roving focus and typeahead, and it announces itself to a
 * screen reader as a list of commands. That is right for a kebab and wrong for a
 * scrollable panel of links carrying its own buttons — arrow keys would fight the
 * scroll, and typeahead would swallow letters. A popover is the honest shape for
 * "a surface, positioned near a trigger".
 *
 * Built on `@base-ui/react`, which `dom/ui/combobox.tsx` already uses and which
 * this file follows exactly: Portal -> Positioner (placement, `z-[230]`) -> Popup
 * (the surface). No second floating token is minted — `bg-popover` is THE
 * floating surface in this design system, shared with dialogs and menus.
