/**
 * The one way a region says its content is still on its way. Nothing shows for the first moments,
 * because most reads here are local and finish unseen; after that, the region's label shimmers
 * quietly in ink-3, like current work does. It never claims the region is empty, holds still under
 * reduced motion, and is announced once as a status. The window's startup has its own loader
 * (`app-loader.ts`); a running agent's turn has `LoadingState`; media keeps its placeholder tile.
