/**
 * One way to re-read something from main: `createRefresher(fetch, apply)`.
 *
 * - Serialized: one read runs at a time. Requests that arrive while it runs queue exactly one
 *   follow-up read, so a burst of notifications costs two reads, and the last one is answered.
 * - Stale answers are dropped: `reset()` (a new bootstrap, a store that moved on) makes every read
 *   already in flight land nowhere.
 * - Failures are caught: a read that fails keeps the last value and ends the burst; `onError`
 *   hears it. The next notification or poll asks again.
