/**
 * The host-to-harness channel on Windows.
 *
 * srt-win does not pass a sandboxed process's stdin through (the Windows runner showed `cat`
 * reading nothing), so the harness cannot hear the host over stdin there. Instead the bootstrap
 * listens on a loopback port the host picked (`HARNESS_INBOX_PORT`), the host connects to it (host
 * to sandbox loopback is allowed; sandbox to sandbox is not), and the first line the host sends is
 * a one-time token (`HARNESS_INBOX_TOKEN`) so no other local process can speak for it. Messages
 * written before the connection is up wait in order. The harness still answers on stdout.
