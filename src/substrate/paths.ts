/**
 * Path containment, in one place: is a path inside a root, and does a relative path from an
 * untrusted writer (a plugin package, the harness) resolve inside its root once links are
 * followed.
 *
 * Two kinds of check, and they are not interchangeable:
 *  - **Lexical** (`isInside`, `isBelow`): the two paths as written, resolved against each other
 *    but never against the disk. Right for a path the caller has already realpathed, or one that
 *    does not exist yet. A link inside the root can still point out; that is the next kind.
 *  - **Real** (`containedReal`): both sides realpathed, so a link out of the root is caught.
 *    Every path a harness or a plugin names is checked this way before anything touches it.
 *
 * The filesystem root contains nothing but itself here: the prefix test is `root + separator`,
 * which for `/` is `//`. No owned root is `/`, and a check that fails closed on a misconfigured
 * root is the one to keep.
