/**
 * Budget ledger — substrate-enforced caps at the engine seam.
 *
 * The harness is agent-editable and cannot be trusted to police its own spending, so the caps
 * live here, checked inside `engine.complete`/`engine.delegate` before anything is dispatched.
 * Two classes of work:
 *
 *  - `"user"` — everything the user asked for. Never blocked by the ledger; the optional hour
 *    cap on a run is the user's own limit, not ours.
 *  - `"improvement"` — SkillOpt passes, architect jobs. Refused while user work is in flight
 *    (improvement never queues ahead of a build) and capped to a share of the day's tokens.
 *
 * The class tag arrives as an RPC param defaulting to `"user"`. The harness can only lie
 * downward: mislabelling its own work "improvement" gets it *more* restrictions, never fewer,
 * and the scheduler that runs real improvement jobs lives host-side where the tag is trustworthy.
