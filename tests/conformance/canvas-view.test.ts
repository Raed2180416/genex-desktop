/**
 * The shared canvas maths — the Builds timeline and the Assets stage pan and zoom through one
 * module, so the numbers it produces are pinned here rather than read off a screenshot.
 *
 * These are the formulas that were inline in `RunGraph.tsx`: a fit centres the content in what is
 * left of the viewport once the drawer has taken its width, and a zoom about a point leaves that
 * point exactly where it was — which is the whole reason a wheel zoom feels like a map and not
 * like a slider.
